A Python script to grab all your photos from flickr and dump them into a directory, organized into folders by set name.

Original author is "Colm MacCÃ¡rthaigh":http://www.stdlib.net/~colmmacc/.

Dan Benjamin tweaked the script to download full-size original images and made improvements in handling UTF8 file and photoset names.

This is yet another modified version that adds two command-line parameters to Dan/Colm's script:

<pre>
-u USER, --user USER  Flickr username to retrieve photos from. In flickr format, 
                      can be calculated from a "human" username from http://idgettr.com

-a ALBUM, --album ALBUM
                      Album to retrieve. If not specified, retrieve all albums. Specified 
                      as photoset ID (last number in photoset URL)
</pre>

Run it like this:

<pre>
mkdir FlickrBackupFolder
python flickrtouchr.py FlickrBackupFolder
</pre>

or, to download images belonging to a certain user (and that you have permission to see, of course):
<pre>python flickrtouchr.py -u 97192136@N12 FlickrBackupFolder
</pre>

or a specific photoset:
<pre>python flickrtouchr.py -u 97192136@N12 -a 72552661214670443 FlickrBackupFolder
</pre>

or even both:
<pre>python flickrtouchr.py -u 97192136@N12 -a 82353261514672343 FlickrBackupFolder
</pre>

You'll be prompted to authorize with Flickr, and then the magic happens.
